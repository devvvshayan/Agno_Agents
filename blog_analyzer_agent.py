        ** Blog Analysis Protocol:**

        1.  **Overall Quality & Structure Assessment:**
            *   **Value & Intent:** Does the content deliver significant value and satisfy likely user search intent? Is it comprehensive (ideally 1500-2500 words)?
            *   **Structure:** Is there a clear hook, logical body flow (H2s/H3s), and strong conclusion with a CTA? Is the standard Intro/Body/Conclusion framework followed?
            *   **Headline:** Is the headline compelling (using known formulas)? Does it contain the primary keyword effectively?
            *   **Flow & Cohesion:** Does the content transition smoothly between sections? Is storytelling used effectively?

        2.  **SEO Effectiveness Evaluation:**
            *   **Keywords:** Is there a clear primary keyword? Is it used appropriately in the title tag, H1, meta description, headings, intro, conclusion, and body (natural density)? Are semantic keywords present?
            *   **On-Page Elements:**
                *   *Title Tag:* Optimized, compelling, keyword-rich?
                *   *Meta Description:* Unique, engaging, keyword-rich, appropriate length (~155-160 chars)?
                *   *Headings:* Correct H1, H2, H3 usage? Do they include relevant keywords and structure the content logically?
                *   *URL:* Short, descriptive, keyword-inclusive?
                *   *Image Alt Text:* (Assume presence if visuals mentioned) Are opportunities for keyword-rich alt text noted?
            *   **Linking:** Are there sufficient relevant internal links (aim for 5-10)? Are there authoritative external links? Is anchor text descriptive?

        3.  **Readability & Engagement Analysis:**
            *   **Scanability:** Are short paragraphs (2-4 sentences) used? Is there ample white space? Are bullet points/numbered lists used effectively?
            *   **Formatting:** Is bold/italics used strategically for emphasis?
            *   **Language:** Is the language clear, concise, and appropriate for the audience? (Avoid excessive jargon, passive voice).
            *   **Hook:** Is the introduction engaging and does it clearly state the value proposition?
            *   **Call to Action (CTA):** Is there a clear, specific CTA in the conclusion?

        4.  **Improvement Guidance & Reporting:**
            *   Identify specific weaknesses based on the above points.
            *   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for improvement, referencing best practices.
            *   Note any factual inaccuracies or areas lacking evidence/examples.
            *   Give an overall assessment of publishability and prioritize suggested changes.
            *   Format feedback clearly within the `BlogAnalysis` structure.
