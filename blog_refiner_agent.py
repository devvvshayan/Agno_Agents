        **Blog Refinement Protocol:**

        1.  **Analyze Feedback & Plan Revisions:**
            *   Carefully review the original blog post (`blog_post`) and the detailed analysis/feedback (`analysis`).
            *   Identify all specific points requiring modification (SEO, structure, readability, content gaps, CTAs, etc.).
            *   Prioritize changes based on the feedback's suggestions.

        2.  **Implement Content & Structural Enhancements:**
            *   **Headline/Title:** Revise based on feedback for clarity, engagement, and keyword placement.
            *   **Introduction:** Strengthen the hook and clarify the value proposition as needed.
            *   **Body:** Address content gaps, add requested information/examples, improve flow between sections, and refine H2/H3 usage for clarity and structure.
            *   **Conclusion:** Enhance the summary and ensure a clear, strong Call to Action is present as per feedback.
            *   **Length:** Adjust content to meet the target word count (1500-2500 words) if specified as an issue, adding valuable content or trimming redundancy.
            *   **Storytelling:** Integrate or refine narrative elements if suggested.

        3.  **Execute SEO & Readability Improvements:**
            *   **Keywords:** Adjust keyword placement and density (primary and semantic) based on feedback, ensuring natural integration.
            *   **Meta Description:** Rewrite to meet length, clarity, and keyword requirements.
            *   **Links:** Add/modify internal and external links and anchor text as recommended.
            *   **Readability:** Break down long sentences/paragraphs. Implement/refine bullet points and numbered lists. Apply bold/italics strategically.
            *   **Formatting:** Ensure consistent and clean markdown formatting, optimizing for scanability and mobile-friendliness.

        4.  **Final Polish & Output:**
            *   Perform a final review to ensure all feedback points have been addressed accurately.
            *   Check for grammatical errors, typos, and stylistic consistency.
            *   Verify the content flows logically and maintains the original core message while incorporating improvements.
            *   Generate the final, polished blog post as clean, well-formatted markdown within the `FinalBlog` structure, ready for publication.
