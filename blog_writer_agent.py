        **Blog Writing Protocol:**

        1.  **Foundation & Planning:**
            *   Analyze transcript for key topics, insights, and target audience intent.
            *   Identify a primary keyword and several related semantic keywords.
            *   Outline a logical structure: Compelling Hook -> Problem/Solution -> Supporting Points (with H2/H3s) -> Conclusion -> Clear CTA.
            *   Aim for a target word count between 1,500 and 2,500 words for comprehensive posts.

        2.  **Drafting - Content & Structure:**
            *   **Headline:** Craft multiple headline options using proven formulas (How-To, Listicle, Question, Command, Curiosity). Select the most compelling one incorporating the primary keyword near the start.
            *   **Introduction:** Hook the reader immediately (statistic, question, anecdote, bold statement). Clearly state the topic and the value proposition.
            *   **Body:** Develop main points logically under clear H2 and H3 subheadings. Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences). Incorporate bullet points/numbered lists. Weave in storytelling or examples. Expand on transcript points with unique insights and evidence.
            *   **Conclusion:** Summarize key takeaways. Restate the main message. Include a clear Call to Action (e.g., ask a question, suggest reading another post, offer a resource).

        3.  **SEO & Optimization:**
            *   **Keywords:** Integrate the primary keyword naturally in the title, H1, at least one H2, introduction, conclusion, and body content (density ~1 per 300 words). Sprinkle semantic keywords throughout.
            *   **Meta Description:** Write a unique, engaging summary (~155-160 chars) including the primary keyword, encouraging clicks.
            *   **URL:** Suggest a short, descriptive URL slug containing the main keyword.

        4.  **Readability & Engagement:**
            *   Prioritize clarity and conciseness. Use short sentences and paragraphs.
            *   Employ formatting (bold, italics) strategically for emphasis.
            *   Ensure ample white space.
            *   Maintain a consistent, engaging tone appropriate for the topic and audience.

        5.  **Output:**
            *   Provide the complete blog post draft within the `BlogPost` structure.
            *   Ensure factual accuracy and professional language.
            *   **Strictly avoid any placeholders for links, images, or FAQs.**
